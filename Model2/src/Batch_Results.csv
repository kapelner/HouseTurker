","  When living in this unit you will enjoy city life from day to night. Chicagos West loop is a diverse neighborhood of architecture, culture and large population growth. According to Crains Chicago Business, the West Loop is the #1 Chicago area zip code for population growth. Park Alexandria Building sits right on the eastern edge of the west loop providing its residents with convenient access to the loop for work, fast access to the highways for weekend get-a ways, fantastic night life and dining in Greek town and the downtown Opera and theaters. Surprisingly the neighborhood, while busy during the day, settles down after 6pm and allows the residents to enjoy quiet evenings and nights that the city provides. The city is also in the midst of converting a city block to park land directly across the street to Park Alexandria. A corner of that land is already completed and is a great place to jog your pets, play frisbee or just sit and enjoy the sun. On transportation, the CTA buses and Metra are very easily accessible from Union Station and the CityCorp Building. The CTA blue line is a few blocks south of the Park Alexandria. The city provides several bike lanes around the building that makes it convenient to ride to the lake and enjoy the bike trails there or to tour the neighborhood via bike. The river taxi's during the spring to late fall provide quick pleasant rides to the Michigan Ave docks or directly to Navy Pier. There are always a lot of things to do and sights to see in Chicago. With the buildings location you will be right at the heart of it all.The building has a rooftop sundeck with dog run, a fitness facility, hospitality room, and 2 guest units in the commercial space and a dry cleaner. The unit is on the 18th floor. It is bright and open with its design. The unit's floor plan promotes the residents' imagination and creativity as how the living space could be arranged. There is a murphy wall bed behind the couch. While you sleep in the living area, the space you see when you enter the unit could be a den or sitting area. With a designer's mind, this unit will provide you peaceful rest when you leave your beloved city life behind.This condo unit is clean, well-maintained, and with updated kithcen counter top and appliances.

Wilson and completed in 1908. Many original architectural elements have been preserved, including ornate plaster moldings, extensive millwork, custom built-in casework, 6 working fireplaces, original door hardware, a double staircase, and a counterweight pulley-operated elevator. The home is set on a magnificent half-acre lot and was featured in the 1996 movie Chain Reaction with Keanu Reaves.Purchased in 2004, the residence remained vacant for nearly two years as it was meticulously renovated. Garry Hattam was the contractor, and Eric Mullendore, known for his expertise in the refurbishment of historic homes, was the architect. The outdoor space was redesigned by Heffernan Landscape Design.More than $2 million has been invested into the home since 2004, and the result provides the best of both worlds: historic significance and character combined with 21st century amenities. Today, the home offers approximately 8,800 square feet of living space plus a 2,600 square foot basement.

","  This landmark residence was designed by Horatio R. Wilson and completed in 1908. Many original architectural elements have been preserved, including ornate plaster moldings, extensive millwork, custom built-in casework, 6 working fireplaces, original door hardware, a double staircase, and a counterweight pulley-operated elevator. The home is set on a magnificent half-acre lot and was featured in the 1996 movie Chain Reaction with Keanu Reaves.Purchased in 2004, the residence remained vacant for nearly two years as it was meticulously renovated. Garry Hattam was the contractor, and Eric Mullendore, known for his expertise in the refurbishment of historic homes, was the architect. The outdoor space was redesigned by Heffernan Landscape Design.More than $2 million has been invested into the home since 2004, and the result provides the best of both worlds: historic significance and character combined with 21st century amenities. Today, the home offers approximately 8,800 square feet of living space plus a 2,600 square foot basement. There is ample family and entertaining space, as well as an oversized master suite, up to 5-7 additional bedrooms, 6 full baths, and 3 powder rooms. In addition, there is a new 4-car garage with a gated side drive. Featured in Crains Chicago Business, the backyard offers fabulous recreational space within a completely private environment.The home is located in the Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District, which includes some of the largest and most architecturally significant homes in Chicago.Hyde Park is home to the acclaimed University of Chicago and a vibrant commercial district that includes the Harper Theater cinema and numerous restaurants. A Whole Foods Market location will open in 2014, complimenting the existing Treasure Island Foods.The area is known for its lush, beautiful parks and recreational amenities including the 365-acre Washington Park, the public beaches, the lakefront trail, and the Museum of Science and Industry. To the north, the new 31st Street Harbor offers 1,000 boat slips.With the expressway and the Green Line L to its west and Lake Shore Drive and the Metra train on the east, Hyde Park offers commuters fast, easy access to downtown.If you think this home might be right for you, please call or email us.

The home is set on a magnificent half-acre lot and was featured in the 1996 movie Chain Reaction with Keanu Reaves.Purchased in 2004, the residence remained vacant for nearly two years as it was meticulously renovated. Garry Hattam was the contractor, and Eric Mullendore, known for his expertise in the refurbishment of historic homes, was the architect. The outdoor space was redesigned by Heffernan Landscape Design.More than $2 million has been invested into the home since 2004, and the result provides the best of both worlds: historic significance and character combined with 21st century amenities.
