"^"  This landmark residence was designed by Horatio R. Wilson and completed in 1908. Many original architectural elements have been preserved, including ornate plaster moldings, extensive millwork, custom built-in casework, 6 working fireplaces, original door hardware, a double staircase, and a counterweight pulley-operated elevator. The home is set on a magnificent half-acre lot and was featured in the 1996 movie Chain Reaction with Keanu Reaves.Purchased in 2004, the residence remained vacant for nearly two years as it was meticulously renovated. Garry Hattam was the contractor, and Eric Mullendore, known for his expertise in the refurbishment of historic homes, was the architect. The outdoor space was redesigned by Heffernan Landscape Design.More than $2 million has been invested into the home since 2004, and the result provides the best of both worlds: historic significance and character combined with 21st century amenities. Today, the home offers approximately 8,800 square feet of living space plus a 2,600 square foot basement. There is ample family and entertaining space, as well as an oversized master suite, up to 5-7 additional bedrooms, 6 full baths, and 3 powder rooms. In addition, there is a new 4-car garage with a gated side drive. Featured in Crains Chicago Business, the backyard offers fabulous recreational space within a completely private environment.The home is located in the Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District, which includes some of the largest and most architecturally significant homes in Chicago.Hyde Park is home to the acclaimed University of Chicago and a vibrant commercial district that includes the Harper Theater cinema and numerous restaurants. A Whole Foods Market location will open in 2014, complimenting the existing Treasure Island Foods.The area is known for its lush, beautiful parks and recreational amenities including the 365-acre Washington Park, the public beaches, the lakefront trail, and the Museum of Science and Industry. To the north, the new 31st Street Harbor offers 1,000 boat slips.With the expressway and the Green Line L to its west and Lake Shore Drive and the Metra train on the east, Hyde Park offers commuters fast, easy access to downtown.If you think this home might be right for you, please call or email us.
